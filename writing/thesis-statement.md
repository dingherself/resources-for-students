# Crafting a Thesis

In an undergraduate philosophy paper, we most often want students to *argue* for or against a certain view.

## What’s a thesis?

A thesis clearly and concisely states

1. the position you are taking (“I argue that love is not a longing for unification with one’s missing half, as Aristophanes jokingly suggests in Plato’s *Symposium*, . . .”), as well as
2. your reason for taking that position (“. . . because true love has to be forged, not found.”).

Here’s an example in context, with the thesis in bold:

> A crucial step in [the feminist] movement has been the recognition that the preferences of both men and women are in some respects distorted by a legacy of injustice and hierarchy. **Such a recognition, I shall argue, is not intrinsically undemocratic: indeed, when appropriately constrained, it is at the heart of the most profound liberal-democratic thought in both the Utilitarian and the Kantian traditions.** Understanding this is important not just because it helps us read the past correctly but, above all, because it helps us choose directions for the future.[^nussbaum]

[^nussbaum]: Martha Nussbaum, “American Women: Preferences, Feminism, Democracy,” in *Sex and Social Justice* (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 132 (my emphasis).

> A road map tells the reader what to expect in each part of the paper:
> 
> > In the first section, I will . . . . Then, I will . . . . Finally, I will . . . .
>
> This is not a thesis; it serves a different function. A road map sometimes follows the thesis, but it is not the thesis itself.

## What’s a *good* thesis?

One common mistake is a thesis that’s overbroad or overambitious:

> In this essay, I will suggest that utilitarianism is the correct moral theory on the grounds that it is the most intuitive.

It’s just not the kind of thing you can defend in a short paper.

The flip side of the mistake is to argue for something that’s too obviously true/false:

> Bravery is a virtue, and so I argue that we should be brave.

In other words, a good thesis should be *just narrow enough* to be **arguable**.

1. It should carve out a *genuine/non-trivial* question that is also *answerable* within the space you have.
2. It should offer a more or less *original* (as one of my undergraduate professors likes to say, *newsworthy to your classmates*) answer to that question in a way that extends our discussions.
3. It should also be *well focused*, *clearly stated*, and *easily identifiable*.
